\label{Use cases}
The work we have done over the course of this project has concluded with a final plug-in for which the scope of functionality can be further expanded, with our current code base providing the basis for further development into areas such as:

\begin{itemize}
\item Code generation to a greater extent. This could include generation of code for broadcast receivers and Intent callback methods.
\item Automatic code completion.
\item Extracting Intent calls from existing code.
\item Acquiring the data for Intent code generation, from an external database.
\item Adding permissions to the manifest file automatically, if the data we have concerning a specific Intent indicates that it is required.
\end{itemize}
