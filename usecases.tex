\label{Use cases}
The work we have done over the course of this project has concluded with a final plug-in for which the scope of functionality can be further expanded, with our current code base providing the basis for further development into areas such as:

	- Code generation to a greater extent. This could include generation of code for broadcast receivers and Intent callback methods.

	- Automatic code completion.

	- Extracting Intent calls from existing code.

	- Acquiring the data for Intent code generation, from an external database.

	- Adding permissions to the manifest file automatically, if the data we have concerning a specific Intent indicates that it is required.
